# Portfolio Two Server

### What is the project?

Rather than a specific project this a compilation of projects.
This is the exact repository that is pulled to my AWS EC2 server.

Most other projects are complied with webpack or parcel so visit their individual repositories.

### Hosted projects are:

- [React-App](https://github.com/rewitt94/portfolio-two-frontend)
- [Submarine](https://github.com/rewitt94/submarine)
- [Reversi](https://github.com/rewitt94/reversi)
- [Bowling](https://github.com/rewitt94/bowling)
